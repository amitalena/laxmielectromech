            <p style="font-size: 16px; margin: 2px 0;">
                A <b>Remote I/O Module</b> is an essential component in industrial automation and process control systems, designed 
                to extend input and output signals over long distances. It enables seamless communication between sensors, actuators, 
                and controllers, reducing wiring complexity and ensuring efficient data transmission. These modules provide a flexible 
                and scalable solution for integrating distributed control systems with <b>Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC)</b>, 
                <b>Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA)</b>, and other automation devices.
